# AI Portrait Generator üé®

An application that allows users to create stylized portraits based on a trained model.

## Process and Goal üí™

The AI Portrait Generator is meant to empower users with the ability to create artistic and stylized portraits of me, or any other image they desire. 

The development of this project involved utilizing a Dreambooth model that I trained with my own images. This model, aptly combined with the [HuggingFace's](https://huggingface.co/) Machine Learning capabilities and [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release), enables users to generate portraits in any style they want.

The project was initialized using the [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) framework, in combination with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), for a smooth and efficient development process. The final project is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

The most exciting part of this project development has been to see the various artistic portraits created by users. Utilizing the app's capabilities, users can generate unique, vibrant, and stylistically varied images, which has been an absolute delight to witness.
